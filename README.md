Make space for Notes on PDF
===========================

I have a tablet with a pen as ebook-reader. 
I like to make notes on the side of the PDFs when reading. 
Often there is not enough space on the margins. 

I also like to draw diagrams and notes on the PDF. 
There is not enough space at the top and bottom. 
This leads to bad nodes and diagrams I can not decypher later.

This tool adds margins left and right of the text and adds 
blank pages between each page. With this I have enough space
for my thoughts and ideas and space to learn.

FEATURES:

* Add margins left and right of the document
* Add a blank page after each page in the PDF
